# EnrolmentTracker
When running, the system stores all subject enrolments in an array (arrEnrolments). A user may list those enrolments, sort them, and delete an
enrolment. As students complete their studies their marks are updated and grades are determined.
Enrolments with marks that are pass or better are moved to an array of unit completions (arrCompletions).
The system allows a user to list all completions as well as count the number of HDs as well as
display some other statistics.
